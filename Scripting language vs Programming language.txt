B...$$Differences between scripting language vs programming language$$

## Scripting language:
1. Scripting language is a programming language supporting scripts written exclusively for a special runtime environment to automate a specific action/function execution.
2. It is written in one language and interpreted within another program. For instance, JavaScript has to be incorporated within HTML, which the Internet browser will then interpret.
3. It do not create create .exe executable files.
4. In this design made to make coding easier and faster.
5. In this code functins are easier as it requires only a few short and specific lines to be written.
6. It is having two subcategories: Server-side scripting languages and client-side scripting languages.
7. In the other hand, demand line-by-line conversion and require host.
8. Scripting language is slower in speed.
Examples:JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rexx, GameMonkey, etc.,
# Advantages:
1. They’re free and open source. As a result, anyone from anywhere on the planet can use it and contribute to it.
2. If you are a beginner, they are a great way to start with programming languages, as they are quite easy to learn and code.
3. They require less memory because no executable file is created.
4. They are portable i.e. can run on any operating system.
# Disadvantages:
1. Scripting languages are slow as they demand line-by-line conversion.
2. The interpreter in scripting languages analyses each statement line by line during execution, hence there aren’t many improvements to make the code run faster.

## Programming language:
1. Programming language is a set of instructions that can be fed into a computer to achieve a specific output.
2. They are compressed into smaller packages that do not need to be interpreted by another language or application.
3. The code when compiled creates binary code executable files also known as .exe files that take memory.
4. The design are made to make full-pledged code and software development easier.
5. In this languages the development codes  are relatively difficult as many lines of code are required for a single function.
6. They are divided into five subcategories: First generation, Second generation, Third generation, Fourth generation, and Fifth generation. 
7. It use a compiler, it is a one-shot conversion. They are self-executable; they do not require a host.
8. The programming languages speed are faster.
Examples: C, C++, C#, Java, Basic, COBOL, and Pascal..etc.
#Advantages:
1. Programming languages are programmer-friendly. They are easy to write, debug and maintain.
2. It provides a higher level of abstraction from machine languages.
3. Less error-prone, easy to find and debug errors.
4. Programming language results in better productivity and easy to learn.
#Disadvantages:
1. It takes additional translation times to translate the source to machine code.
2. Programs are comparatively slower than low-level programs.
3. Compared to scripting language, they are generally less memory efficient.
4. Cannot communicate directly with the hardware.
